        "Forget Swansea , Stoke City and West Ham , the top seven would be seriously challenged by ' Team Pardew ' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club . That is after Crystal Palace , managed by Alan Pardew , beat Manchester City 2 - 1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night , the English manager 's ninth win   in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December . His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half , and combining his records at both clubs this season would see ' Team Pardew ' sit in eighth place , just five points behind Southampton . Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace . The Premier League table with Team Pardew in - as well as a team complied from pre / post Pardew results . Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew 's head for many years , seen as owner Mike Ashley 's puppet , and were sitting in 10th place when the 53 - year - old returned ' home ' to Crystal Palace . The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City , struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock 's sacking . But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James ' Park , Pardew 's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone . A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace 's stats pre / post Pardew would be sitting in 19th ( albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved ) . A top - half finish is now the aim for Pardew and his men , as Toon supporters still fear relegation following a 1 - 0 derby defeat to Sunderland on Easter Sunday . Pardew celebrates with his Newcastle team and Moussa SIssoko after his goal against QPR in November . Newcastle fans hold a banner calling the removal of Pardew in a Premier League game at Stoke in September . John Carver 's Toon side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1 - 0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland . It all started with a 4 - 0 win at Dover Athletic in the FA Cup and now Crystal Palace have won four in five , most recently beating the champions . His stock will continue to rise with this table , which would put him just six points adrift of Liverpool in fifth . Pardew has recently insisted he would perform at a top club , better than Monday 's counterpart Manuel Pellegrini at least , while he is definitely a contender for Premier League Manager of the Year award . And nobody would have predicted that in 2014 . Glenn Murray celebrates after netting the opening goal during Crystal Palace 's victory over Manchester City .", "This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21 - year - old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible . ' I 'm so happy , ' Nyia Parler , 41 , commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday . Just 24 hours earlier , police say she wheeled her care - dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there , before going to stay with her partner in Maryland . Relatives , who had been contacted by the boy 's school when he did n't turn up to class on Tuesday , commented on Parler 's picture , ' nyia call me asap , ' and ' How the hell you happy ? ! ? Call me ! ' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself . Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an ' undisclosed condition ' and faces charges including aggravated assault , reckless endangering , neglect of a care - dependent person , kidnapping , unlawful restraint and false imprisonment , according to police in Pennsylvania . ' When her treatment is completed , we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition , ' Capt . Paul Starks of the Montgomery County , Maryland , police said in a statement . Chilling : This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible . Relatives contacted by the boy 's school frantically replied . Charged : Parler ( right ) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night , charged with assault and neglect . Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson ( left ) in Montgomery County , Maryland . Horrific : The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket , 10 feet from his wheelchair . He 'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend , John Ferguson , police said . He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park . Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday . She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland , said Lt . John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division . Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home , and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place : ' She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area , takes him out of wheelchair , lays him on the ground , puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him , and then just walks away . ' During the period he was exposed to the elements , the young man was ' completely defenseless ' in an area with wild animals , with no water and in cold , damp weather , Walker said . ' It 's only by the grace of God that he survived this . Amazing , ' he said . Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler ( pictured ) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man 's school became concerned about her absence , the victim 's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her , Walker said . ' Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful , ' he said . Her boyfriend , however , assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and ' was in shock when he learned what happened , ' Walker said . A 16 - year - old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives , Walker added . Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration , malnutrition , a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries , but he appeared to be improving . ' He seemed to be a little happier yesterday , ' Walker said . ' You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable . The 21 - year - old , who is non - verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy , is now in Philadelphia Children 's Hospital with his aunts , where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes . Officials told \xa0 NBC Philadelphia \xa0 her son would have died if he had n't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street . ' This kid is obviously a fighter . It 's just unbelievable how we found him last night . It 's just heartbreaking to see how another human , especially a mother , could treat him like that , ' Lt . Walker of Philadelphia Police told \xa0 ABC . Abandoned : A passerby noticed the 21 - year - old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration , malnutrition , a cut to his back and eye injuries . According to Philly.com \xa0 two of his aunts , who are with him in hospital , have been trying to obtain guardianship for years . A neighbor , who declined to be identified , told DailyMail.com : ' She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair , she seemed to care for him . Whenever I saw him , I saw her . ' Another , who also wished to remain anonymous , said : ' I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school . Nothing looked wrong , I did n't suspect anything . ' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers . ' A lot of things could have happened out there , ' he said . ' Obviously he 's in the middle of a wooded area . You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself . He does not function at all . ' Walker added : ' What we 've learned so far is that the 21 - year - old child lives with his mother , completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition . ' She also has a 16 - year - old son who is staying with other family members . ' We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus . ' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia 's School Of The Future on Monday . However , when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well . Rescuers used flashlights to find the non - verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night . Investigation : Police arrested the man 's 41 - year - old mother , who left him alone in the park on Monday morning to visit her boyfriend in Maryland . Officers recovered the man 's wheelchair ( pictured ) for evidence .", '( CNN)The Cuba that photographer Carolina Sandretto captures is a world away from the images of neon 1950s American cars and postcard - worthy white sand beaches that most visitors to the island bring back home . Instead Sandretto focuses on " solares , " the crumbling buildings that many Cubans divide and cohabitate , often with several generations and separate families sharing one dwelling . " This situation of bringing into your house your husband or your wife and living with your own parents in your late 30s and 40s , I always thought is really interesting and different than the U.S. but similar to my country since that \'s the way it was 50 years ago , " said Sandretto , who is from Italy . Following Fidel Castro \'s 1959 revolution , houses and apartments were redistributed throughout Cuba and the government promised that everyone would have a home in the new socialist utopia . But building did not keep pace with the population , and Cubans were forced to adapt by dividing and re - dividing up homes to make room . " It ends up to be a very interesting habitat , " Sandretto said . " Because there ( are ) so many different layers of people . It creates a whole community , even if neighbors really do n\'t like each other . " Sandretto said she first visited Cuba three years ago and was instantly hooked . " I stayed and went back and back because it \'s a very unique place and people are really beautiful and amazing and with interesting stories , " she said . Gaining entrance to the maze - like solares was a constant negotiation , Sandretto said , and plenty of times she was turned away . " I always try to explain what I do , why I am there , why I am interested in where they live , the aim of my project , " she said . Toting a 30 - year - old Hasselblad 500 cm camera , Sandretto found it was a good way to strike up a conversation with her subjects . Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography . " They get curious when see someone going around with a bulky old camera , " she said . " I talk a lot . I am Italian . I speak Spanish , which helps but not a lot because you have to speak \' Cuban , \' which is another language . " Her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of Cubans resting in the sweltering heat , crowding around a communal TV or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings . There are no modern appliances or conveniences in her photographs . The people in these solares are n\'t the fortunate Cubans who have relatives visiting from Miami with flat - screens and smartphones in tow . Instead , there is the sense of time being whittled away -- one game of dominoes or one TV soap opera a time . Sandretto said she hopes to continue to document the changes on the island that occur as the United States and Cuba work to restore diplomatic relations and an inevitable influx of American visitors arrive . The thawing in relations could even change life in Cuba \'s solares . " People want to travel , have access to the Internet and improve their economic situation , " she said . " I hope that \'s what happens . " Carolina Sandretto is an Italian photographer based in New York .

As the clock ticked down during QPR 's 3 - 3 away draw with Aston Villa , a cheeky youngster decided to while away a few more seconds by mugging off the former England No 1 with a handmade nutmeg . The ball boy , who initially shames himself by slipping over while retrieving the ball , toys with Green by pretending to hand him the ball back before rolling it between the clearly frustrated 35 - year - old 's legs . The Villa ball boy ( front left ) initially slips over while retrieving the ball behind QPR 's goal . The Rangers No 1 smiles as he moves to retrieve the ball from the youngster during the 3 - 3 draw .

As thick tangles of vine fall beneath his blade , he pushes into a clearing , then suddenly staggers back . The fanged mouth of a primordial stone beast gapes toward him . Before him rise the crumbled ruins of an enormous portal of rock , black with age but with a colossal grandeur not yet lost -- a fine example of what archaeologists call a " zoomorphic portal " or , more popularly , a " monster mouth gate . " What was once the gateway to an ancient Mayan city , built circa 700 AD and mysteriously abandoned four centuries later , stands before him . He has found the lost city of Lagunita . Now that the planet has been mapped , circumnavigated , measured and tagged in every way imaginable , the age of explorers discovering new worlds seems a quaint memory . But there are still adventurers exploring forgotten corners of the globe , and some find astonishing things . One such explorer , part Indiana Jones , part Magellan , is Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Šprajc . The sprightly Šprajc wears the weathered face of a man who has spent much of his 60 years beneath a hot sun at excavations , or hacking his way through dense jungle . He has been the first to see ancient pyramids , 30 meters high , that he spotted in aerial photographs from his office among the Baroque Mitteleuropean cobbled streets of Ljubljana , Slovenia , some 10,000 kilometers away . But in terms of the thrill of discovery , it does n\'t get any better than his encounter with Lagunita \'s monster portal . What does it feel like to find a lost city ?   " It \'s a victory , " says Šprajc , " especially when the efforts are long . On several occasions we \'ve had two , three weeks of just cutting through the bush to get to some location , without knowing what we would find . When we get to the site it feels like a big victory , like we \'ve done it . If it had been easy , then other people would have done it already . " Since 1996 , he and his team have discovered more than 80 ancient Mayan cities in the jungles of Mexico , few of which the modern world had known before . But how can an entire city , which once may have been home to tens of thousands , simply vanish ? Šprajc explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because it \'s so inaccessible : " It \'s so hard to get there . It \'s a biosphere , a protected natural area that has never been densely populated since the collapse of the Classical Mayans , for the past thousand years or so . " When a primal jungle is allowed to grow rampant for centuries , it can indeed swallow entire cities . But just why so many settlements were simply abandoned , long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors , remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer . " Ninety - nine percent of settlements in the central and southern lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula were abandoned in a matter of 200 years . By 1000 AD , practically everything was abandoned . That was the situation when the Spaniards came . But not so in the northern section of the peninsula and the Guatemala highlands , where there was no rupture until the arrival of the Spaniards . " So what happened in that enormous area that led to this mass evacuation ? " Nobody knows the exact sequence of events , but it was definitely a combination of droughts , climate change , ( and ) overpopulation , but other things must have come as consequences : devastating raids and wars among the Mayan states , which resembled the constantly battling ancient Greek city - states . " In this Late Classical period , wars intensified with devastating consequences , for if one city - state was destroyed or overcome , it had a ripple effect on trade networks . It was a sort of globalized Mayan world . " To learn more would require extensive , time - consuming surveys of each site , which is a different sort of fieldwork than Šprajc likes to practice . His team will map what appears to be the core of a settlement , but there simply is n\'t time or manpower to map it all , so hundreds of structures are left for others to survey and excavate . The adrenaline of the treasure hunt is what drives Šprajc , the " Eureka " moment when he finds the buried treasure . He is not in the least proprietary about what he discovers , preferring to let other research teams dive in to the sites he has found to slowly excavate , catalogue and analyze what he finds . " [ This extensive mapping ] is not our job .   We are taking the first step into an unknown area . " Šprajc is a throwback to the great 19th century explorers -- a dying breed as the world becomes smaller and science bleaches out its mysteries . But in the heat of the jungle , science can only get you so far .   Intrepid spirit , calloused palms , sweat , blood and patience are more important than gadgetry . As Šprajc likes to say , " We can survive without computers , but not without machetes . " Noah Charney is a professor of art history and best - selling author .

Judge James Hill , QC , said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them . ‘ I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional , ’ he said . ‘ I ca n’t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope , as your commanding officers have expressed , that the Army feels able to keep you . ’ The furious victim James Wormald – who was left with the imprint of Smith ’s shoe on his forehead – said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened . ‘ There was absolutely no reason for the attack , ’ he said . ‘ To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong . With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck , Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them . A judge rejected their version of events , saying the man seen in the footage ( above ) posed ' no threat ' when they were beating him . ‘ I do n’t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries , the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it . ’ Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm . Smith was given a 12 - month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work . Collins was given a 12 - month community order , and both men were each told to pay £ 1,000 compensation . The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service 's sentencing guidelines . With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each , the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years . Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as ' exceptional ' . In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised . Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended , while Collins received a 12 - month community order . The pair launched the vicious attack after a night ’s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April . They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots . They encountered local men Mr Wormald , 25 , and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words . Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them – a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald , a chef . The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald . Their victim runs across a road , trips and falls . Smith , who has a hood covering his face , can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim ’s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald ’s body . The pair then ran off and hid in a stream , but were caught by the police . Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face . Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James ’s Palace since the incident . He is likely to keep his job . Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character . Richard Herrmann , defending him , said : ‘ But for that night this man is an angel , but on that night he was a devil . ’ Captain James Dyson said Smith had ‘ picked himself up ’ since and ‘ is proving to be one of the best performing people in his platoon ’ . Outside court Detective Constable Andy Palmer said : ‘ This is the most violent piece of CCTV footage I have seen in ten years as a police officer and it is extremely fortunate the victims were not more seriously injured . This case highlights the horrors of alcohol - fuelled violence . ’", '( CNN)It \'s the simplest possible assignment , but it always teaches a huge lesson . Every year , Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz passes out Post - it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence , " I wish my teacher knew ... " Many of the students she teaches at Doull Elementary just wish they had something in common with her , that she knew soccer or video games . But sometimes , their wishes bring tears to her eyes , and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives . There \'s a student who misses her father : " I have n\'t seen him in six years . " Another who wants to tell her she \'s lonely : " I do n\'t have friend to play with me . " Still another who wants to explain why her reading log goes unsigned : " My mom is not around a lot . " And other who has big hopes for the future : " I want to go to college . " The assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time , Schwartz said : " What do our students need ? How can we best serve them ? " Schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous ; of sharing them only with her , or with the entire class . It surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud , like the shy student who shared , " I wish my teacher knew I \'m nervous all the time . " " They feel respected , they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones , " said Schwartz , who has been teaching for three years . " Kids can share what they feel comfortable with . " Recently , Schwartz began to post some students \' responses on Twitter using the hashtag # IWishMyTeacherKnew . It spread , as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms . They sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now , like the child whose mother was sick , or another who had just experienced bullying . One student just wants more attention from the teacher . Sometimes , they have a little fun : " I wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip . " Occasionally , students want to reassure their teachers that that they \'re doing a great job . There \'s a lot for teachers to learn , too : " They are KIDS who deal with a lot as they grow up , " one educator posted on Twitter . Schwartz said she \'s learned not to assume what her students wish . Although most of the students at her school live in poverty , not every message is about a material need . There \'s no pressure to share something they \'re not ready to talk about , she said , and " they \'re acutely aware of their own needs . " Through assignments like this , she is , too . As her idea spread , many Twitter users asked how they can help to support her students . She \'s pointed them toward a DonorsChoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list . So far , most have been fulfilled .', "If you 're an iPhone or iPad owner , your encrypted passwords , bank details and other private details may be at risk from hackers .

The unnamed 20 - year - old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County , north of Denver , when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck . In a chilling 911 call from around 11 pm Wednesday night , she told operators : ' I 'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I 'm bleeding from my neck and I 'm scared . ' I do n't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window ... my neck hurts . I think there 's glass in my neck . ' Scroll down for video . Highway shooting : A bullet passed clean through a woman 's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver , Colorado . She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck . Miraculously , the bullet did not damage the woman 's airway or sever any major blood vessels . She is expected to recover , according to 7News Denver . The woman , from the nearby town of Milliken , said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound . Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff 's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado . Hours before the woman was shot , a man 's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a ' pop ' sound which could have been gunfire . The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified ' projectile ' , the Coloradoan \xa0 reported .

Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services . ' We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and , while we are unable to go into detail , we have already taken further security measures .

However , upon closer inspection , it was apparent that the photograph emerged after a bit of camera trickery , and the longer hairdo and dangly earrings did in fact belong to a woman stood directly behind him . The comical image emerged amid claims the president of Zimbabwe is lining up his 24 - year - old daughter to succeed him . Scroll down for video . At a glance , Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appeared to be sporting a new hairstyle and even a pair of earrings when he arrived into South Africa for a state visit today , but it was in fact just a cleverly taken shot . It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91 - year - old dictator has surfaced , with one of him falling down podium steps becoming an internet sensation earlier this year . The photo , which showed the president taking a tumble after addressing supporters at Harare Airport , was turned into numerous memes showing him in imagined circumstances , such as part of Beyonce 's Single Ladies choreography , surfing or running from security forces . However , Mugabe failed to see the funny side and reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall . Mugabe arrived into Pretoria , South Africa today for a three - day state visit to the country amid ongoing speculation that his daughter will assume the position of president after him . He had originally planned for his wife Grace to replace him but , due to her deteriorating health , Mugabe is now said to be keen for his daughter Bona to step up . Last year , Mugabe promoted his wife to a senior position within his ruling ZANU - PF party where she led a vicious campaign to remove former vice - president Joice Mujuru from office . Mujuru was long considered a likely successor to Mugabe but she fell out with the veteran leader late last year and was sacked as vice - president in December . It is not the first time an amusing image of the 91 - year - old dictator has emerged , with one of him falling down podium steps outside Zimbabwe 's Harare Airport ( pictured ) becoming an internet sensation earlier this year . The photograph , which showed the president taking a fall , was turned into numerous memes , including one which super - imposed him onto Kim Kardashian 's iconic ' Break the Internet ' cover for Paper Magazine . Other memes which quickly circulated online showed Mugabe taking part in Athletics alongside Usain Bolt . Mugabe reportedly had no fewer than 27 bodyguards suspended for failing to stop his embarrassing fall . Last week , the ruling ZANU - PF party expelled Mujuru altogether for allegedly plotting against the president . The 59 - year - old was accused of ' plotting to unconstitutionally remove President Robert Mugabe from office ' , according to a statement from Simon Khaya - Moyo , spokesman for the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front . She was also accused of ' orchestrating factionalism in the party thereby causing acrimonious divisions ' and ' engaging in activities that smack of corruption ' . Her allies in government were also fired and expelled from ZANU - PF after Mugabe himself accused her of plotting to oust him . It left experts believing his wife may follow in his footsteps but the 49 - year - old has fallen severely ill in recent months and has been taking regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment . In her absence , his daughter Bona has now taken a more prominent role at the Zimbabwean president 's side at official events and trips . It is claimed that president Robert Mugabe ( centre ) wants his 24 - year - old daughter Bona ( left ) to succeed him . Last month , photographs emerged showing her with Mugabe - who is also in poor health - as part of a state delegation that held talks with Japan 's prime minister . The move sparked furious criticism from opposition parties and political analysts but a ZANU - PF spokesman insisted the move was not politically motivated . In an interview with Nehanda Radio , Psychology Mazivisa said : ' Madam Bona Mugabe has not done anything nearly as much . ' We refuse to buy into the narrative that for as long as it 's President Mugabe doing it , no matter how perfectly lawful it is , it 's wrong ... It 's a barbaric way of doing politics .

He is popular with many FN members and will stand as a candidate in December 's regional elections , despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti - Jewish and for ' inciting racial hatred ' . He has regularly made the comment about the Holocaust , telling the European Parliament in 2009 : ' I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history , which is clear . ' Mr Le Pen was first convicted by a Munich court in 1999 for ' minimising the Holocaust ' after telling a German far - right meeting that Nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are ' what one calls a detail ' . He has had a string of other convictions , including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an MEP in 2003 following a physical attack on a French Socialist MEP .

Zaha joins an ecstatic Bolasie ( left ) after the Congolese forward produced a stunning hat - trick in the second - half against Sunderland . Advocaat had watched from home in Holland four weeks ago as Aston Villa won 4 - 0 at the Stadium of Light . This latest collapse leaves them just two places and three points above the drop zone . And the new boss said : ' I was shocked . You can see what can change in just six days . We were not in the game . Even in the first half Palace were better . ' We gave it all away inside just seven minutes . The work - rate from their strikers and the pace they have made it very difficult . We did not create any chances . That is a big concern . ' But I knew when I started this job that it would be difficult . We still have six games . We can still stay up . We need to get our confidence back . ' Bolasie made a point to go and celebrate with Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew after his quick - fire hat - trick during the 4 - 1 victory . Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe ca n't hide their disappointment having been comprehensively beaten on Saturday . The first half had been a depressing demonstration of two sides fouling one another , an occasional half - chance punctuating the boredom . Jack Rodwell lunged recklessly into the leg of James McArthur with the ball long gone and was lucky to see just yellow . We did see red moments later , albeit the blood streaming from Costel Pantilimon 's mouth after Scott Dann planted his boot in the goalkeeper 's face when competing for a loose ball . Dann , in fairness , was unfortunate to be booked . And the game soon had its third caution when Lee Cattermole , having been robbed by Bolasie on halfway , desperately hauled the forward back by the trim of his shirt . Palace , though , broke the tedium with their early blitz after the break . Bolasie was the provider for the opener when his cross was deflected onto the brow of Murray , who planted home from four yards for his sixth goal in as many matches . Murray tries to keep possession under the attention of Sunderland captain John O'Shea during the contest at the Stadium of Light . The stands emptied during the second - half at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland conceded four goals in quick succession . Bolasie applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping Crystal Palace to a 4 - 1 victory at Sunderland with a fine hat - trick . Within three minutes the livewire Congolese had his first . Dann loaded a ball forward from his own half , Murray rose to flick on and Bolasie escaped to poke through Pantilimon . The visitors were three in front come the 54th minute , and again a long ball proved Sunderland 's undoing as Bolasie pounced to rob the dithering John O'Shea before lifting over Pantilimon . He did not have to wait long for his hat - trick . Palace broke through Murray down the right and he squared for Bolasie who , after out - scrapping Pantilimon and Santiago Vergini , poked home for his first senior treble . Sunderland did steal a barely deserved consolation when Connor Wickham turned in Patrick Van Aanholt 's cross , but it mattered not and news of Leicester and Aston Villa 's victories has them looking down once more . For Pardew , things are very much looking up .", "The U.S Surgeon General has enlisted Elmo to urge American children to get vaccinated in the wake of recent national debate over the right to refuse immunization . A campaign video sees Dr Vivek Murthy and the Sesame Street favourite go through the process of getting vaccinated and explaining to children ( and parents ) why it is so important . In what appears to be a direct response to anti - vaccination campaigners , Elmo and Dr Murthy questions why everybody does not get a shot . Scroll down for video . Campaign : Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Elmo explain why getting vaccinated is crucial to keep other children safe and healthy . As Dr Murthy visits Sesame Street , Elmo tells him he is ' worried about getting a shot , ' asking the Surgeon General : ' Why does everyone need a vaccination , anyway ? ' In response Dr Murthy compares getting vaccinated to using an umbrella when it rains and wearing a helmet on a bike . This calms Elmo who gets the shot he needs , and after realising how quick and painless it is to get a shot , he asks Dr Murthy whey everybody does n't get a vaccination ? ' That 's a good question , Elmo , ' Murthy says , looking at the camera . ' That 's a good question . ' The video , produced by the Daily Dot , is accompanied by a shorter 30 - second video of Elmo and the Surgeon General released by the Department of Health and Human Services . Important message : Dr Murthy explains that the best way Elmo can help him to do his job and keeping Americans healthy , is by getting ' all his Sesame Street friends ' vaccinated too . It sees Dr Murthy explains that the best way Elmo can help him to do his job and keeping Americans healthy , is by getting ' all his Sesame Street friends ' vaccinated too . The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December , sickened 147 people in the U.S. , which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up . Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days — or two incubation periods — meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles . Some cited personal reasons for refusing shots , and others were too young to get the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine . In California , where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found , a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health . The campaign videos have been released amidst debate across the United States over whether vaccines should be compulsory in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December . The measure would bar parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of religious or personal beliefs , joining California with Mississippi and West Virginia in such strict requirements . Medical waivers would only be available for children with health problems , forcing unvaccinated children to be homeschooled . California lawmakers were set to vote on the bill last week , but this was postponed by supporters postponed so authors could work on revisions to address concerns raised in the Senate Education Committee . The proposal 's lead author , Sen. Richard Pan , a Democratic pediatrician from Sacramento , said he is confident he can clarify his bill so lawmakers are comfortable in supporting his bill . ' Every child deserves an opportunity at education , ' Pan said , ' and every child deserves an opportunity to be safe at school . '", "The most popular cities in the world are often instantly \xa0 recognisable thanks to their world - famous landmarks . But what would these cities look like if they did not have \xa0 their \xa0 prized attractions ? That 's what one studio asked its designers , and the images it received back were certainly illuminating . Scroll down for video . Without the 324m - high Eiffel Tower in Paris , the skyline looks incredibly bare and dark , which is not surprising considering it has 336 lamps illuminating it at night . The iconic tower , on the Champ de Mars , was opened in 1889 and has come to define the French capital . The Arc De Triomphe was constructed in 1806 , and is the centrepiece of Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the \xa0 Champs - Élysées . The imposing monument celebrates France 's military glories and also its military heroes - tourists can climb up tot the roof for beautiful views of Paris . Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit before and after graphics of some of the most well known landscapes as we have never seen them before . Nearly 100 submissions have been created , with a number of them focusing on the 300m - high Eiffel Tower in their creations . The startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat , although it did allow for views from the Trocadéro Gardens , through to the Champ de Mars . More missing features in Paris included the impressive Arc De Triomphe . Instead of leading to the famous centrepiece , the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare , round circle . Without the Statue of Liberty to draw boats of tourists , Liberty Island looks forlorn and barren . All that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic \xa0 colossal neoclassical sculpture stood . The Statue of Liberty draws boats of tourists every day , but without the iconic lady , Liberty Island looks nothing special . Siena Cathedral is a medieval church in Siena , Italy that has been around since \xa0 1215 . Its spires and towers peek over the city . The River Thames looks just like any other river with the elegant Tower Bridge stretching across the waterway . The iconic Tower Bridge is featured in nearly every London tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as London Bridge . Designers imaged what London would look like without its most photographed clocktower and Westminster Palace . The Palace of Westminster is more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament , with both the House of Commons and House of Lords based in the Gothic - style waterfront building . London 's attractions draw millions of tourists every year , but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if Big Ben was not a feature on the skyline . It is said to be the most photographed clock in the world , and would not be easy to remove , sitting at over 13 tons . The sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive \xa0 architecture \xa0 of the Palace of Westminster . The banks of River Yamuna , in Agra , look desolate with the majestic presence of the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal is a striking white marble mausoleum in Agra , and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area . A certain Holy presence is missing from the skyline of Rio de Janeiro , making the normally instantly - recognisable city a little more mysterious . Christ the Redeemer overlooks all the goings on in Rio , and makes the city instantly recognisable . The Sydney Harbour stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house , which resembles the sails of a ship , without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers . The beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in Petra , Jordan , was originally part of a \xa0 Nabataean . The rose - red Petra is Jordan 's most prized tourist attraction , and hopefully , being a UNESCO World Heritage Site , will never disappear . Machu Picchu was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911 , leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction . The ruins at the Inca settlement of Machu Picchu in Peru have made the area a bucket list favourite . Niagara Falls without the falls is a dry , barren hole , and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today . On the border of the US and Canada , Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls . The designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops . Without the tumbling 51 - metre - high Niagara Falls , the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year . While the Andes are an incredible sight by themselves , iconic pictures with the ruins at the Incan settlement of Machu Picchu , have made the area a bucket list favourite . Standing at 68 m , the \xa0 Obelisk of Buenos Aires would be missed from the urban landscape behind if it were removed . The Four Face Sculptures of late Presidents on Mount Rushmore have vanished , leaving behind just another normal rockface . Mount Rushmore would be unrecognisable without the presidential presence which has been in place since the carvings were completed between 1934 and 1939 .", '( CNN)Here \'s a pop quiz : What \'s better for America \'s status in the world ? A ) Being a global leader in innovation , job creation , education , social mobility , literacy and child health . B ) Being a global leader in imprisoning the highest number of human beings -- its own citizens . It \'s an obvious answer . But the unfortunate reality is that the United States leads the world in incarceration , not education . Our country has shown time and again a nearly unlimited capacity to reinvent itself and move closer to the ideals on which our society was founded . Yet we have emerged as the global leader in a race that no nation would want to even be a contender in . While our country is home to only 5 % of the world \'s total population , we are home to 25 % of the world \'s prison population . And nearly three fourths of this population is comprised of nonviolent offenders . At the same time , we are losing the increasingly important race to educate our citizens . Where the United States was once ranked first in high school graduation rates , we now rank 23rd in high school completion among 30 of the world \'s most developed nations . Where we were once the driving force of the global economy , we now rank fifth in the World Economic Forum \'s global competitiveness index . Key metrics in this index include the quality of a nation \'s primary , secondary and higher education systems . Instead of empowering the next generation of American artists , scientists , engineers , inventors and entrepreneurs , our country has chosen to devote a massive amount of resources , time and energy to locking people up . By imprisoning individuals , we also burden families , condemn generations to cycles of poverty and breed economic inequality . In the 1980s and 1990s , Congress chose to adopt laws that drastically changed the way our country handled nonviolent drug crimes . Since then , the American prison population has increased by nearly 800 % over the past 30 years . Over 2.7 million American children have a parent who is incarcerated , and 10 million American children at one time in their lives had a parent in prison . Americans of color are disproportionately burdened by the failures of our justice system . There are more black men in prison or under state or federal supervision today than there were enslaved in 1850 . And while African Americans make up only 13.6 % of the total U.S. population , they make up a whopping 40.2 % of the U.S. prison population . The sad reality is that in today \'s America , prisoners are never truly free from the burdens of our criminal justice system . A report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research concluded that once released from prison , an ex - offender \'s prospects for obtaining employment statistically decreased . The report estimated that , in 2008 , ex - offender employment losses cost our economy the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers , or $ 57 billion to $ 65 billion annually . It \'s therefore no surprise that American prisons have become revolving doors , with two out of every three former offenders rearrested within three years of their release . The millions of wives , sisters , husbands , daughters , sons , friends and the people they love who have been incarcerated are burdened disproportionately by an outdated , archaic and overly punitive system . These millions of Americans have the ability to advance our country , our economy and our global competitiveness . They just need to be given the opportunity . American taxpayers are n\'t free from the burdens of our criminal justice system either . In addition to the billions lost in jobs and productivity , Americans spend over a quarter of a trillion dollars each year to keep millions of nonviolent , low - level offenders imprisoned . The price tag is truly staggering . It costs on average $ 29,000 a year to house one inmate at the federal level . In contrast , our country spends a little over $ 11,000 dollars a year per elementary school student .   Imagine the good we could do if we could re - appropriate those tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and economic losses away from imprisonment and toward investment in our children \'s future . We must start to deconstruct the perverse order of our priorities and build a more just society by making needed changes at the federal level . We must examine the way our criminal justice system works -- or rather , does n\'t -- and take the necessary actions to change it . Fortunately , there is already a road map for successfully addressing these problems . We know reforms will work because they already are in states across the country . In both blue states such as New Jersey and Connecticut and red states such as Texas and Georgia , state and local officials have developed and instituted sweeping reforms that have reduced their prison populations and crime rates . They are succeeding by focusing their efforts on areas where the criminal justice system most needs reform . We should follow their example on the federal level . First , we should pass legislation that promotes " front end " reform , such as ending mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug crimes . Secondly , we should pass legislation that enacts " behind the wall " reforms , such as eradicating the cruel practice of juvenile solitary confinement . And thirdly , we should enact " back end " reforms with legislation that assists in sealing criminal records and removing barriers to employment for nonviolent formerly incarcerated people . As we reform our criminal justice system at the national level , we will alter the cycles of poverty and recidivism that plague too many American communities and start to develop virtuous cycles of excellence . Instead of putting resources toward juvenile detention centers , we can put resources toward afterschool programs that have proved to help keep kids out of the juvenile justice system and in school . Instead of losing valuable contributors to our economy because of their status as ex - offenders , we can develop apprenticeship and training programs that improve worker skills and jump start our economy . Instead of asking American taxpayers to pay for warehousing people who commit nonviolent , low - level , crimes , we can make sure that students of all ages have access to math , science and technology schooling that will help them excel in the workforce and as productive members of society . Let \'s devote our resources to empowering our citizens , not imprisoning them . Let \'s choose to raise our expectations as a country , and let \'s meet them .', "Despite the hype surrounding its first watch , the iPhone is still the engine behind Apple 's phenomenal success , its latest figures have revealed . The results far surpassed most analysts ' expectations for the first three months of the year , when sales traditionally fall from their holiday - season peak . Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter , accounting for more than two - thirds of its $ 58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion 's share of its $ 13.6 billion in profit - and up 40 % from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US . Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter , accounting for more than two - thirds of its $ 58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion 's share of its $ 13.6 billion in profit . $ 58 billion in revenue , $ 13.6 billion in profit . $ 200 billion in cash , up from around $ 150 billion a year ago . More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29 % to $ 5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier , to $ 5.6 billion . ' We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone , Mac and the App Store , which drove our best March quarter results ever , ' said Tim Cook , Apple 's CEO . ' We 're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we 've experienced in previous cycles , and we 're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch . ' As expected , the numbers were down from the previous quarter , when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple 's new iPhone 6 , 6 Plus and older models . But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014 . ' We 're seeing great results all over the world , ' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press , adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China , where the company has big hopes for expansion . Other products played a much smaller role . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier , to $ 5.6 billion , while iPad revenue fell 29 percent , to $ 5.4 billion — continuing a steady decline in tablet sales . Apple did n't report any results for the new Apple Watch , which it began selling this month , after the quarter ended . Maestri said customer response had been ' positive . ' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date , suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions . Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year , making it the world 's most valuable company . ' It 's been really great to see the reaction of customers , ' said Cook . ' The response has been overwhelming . We ca n't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up . ' The iPhone is another story . Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall , Apple has vied with South Korea 's Samsung for the No . 1 position in the global smartphone market . By some estimates , Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December , and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week . Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors . The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent , to 52 cents a share , and has increased a $ 90 billion stock buyback program to $ 140 billion . Apple did n't report any results for the new Apple Watch , which it began selling this month , after the quarter ended . In total , the company said the program will return $ 200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017 . As iPhone sales have surged , so has Apple 's stock . Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year , making it the world 's most valuable company . The stock closed Monday at $ 132.65 , up 1.8 percent for the day , and was rising in late trading . The iPhone is n't just Apple 's ' dominant product , ' said Frank Gillett , a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research . ' It 's more than anything else what 's driving the success of their company . ' Market researchers , however , expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year , particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes , as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one . That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace . ' They 're extremely dependent on the iPhone , ' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners . ' At some point , the market dynamics change , ' he said , adding that ' the question is what could replace the iPhone ' if sales begin to slow . Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai , China , on January 14 , 2014 . Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he 's optimistic about new markets such as China , where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China 's Xiaomi . And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models , ' that 's still a pretty healthy market , ' said Gartner analyst Van Baker , noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007 . Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay , the company 's mobile payment service . While these currently provide minimal revenue , analysts say they have big potential . And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone , which means each may bolster the other 's popularity in the future , Gillett said .", "David Cameron has made no secret of the fact that he gets broody around babies , but his wife Samantha has ruled out adding to the family in Number 10 . In another joint interview on the election campaign trail , the couple were insistent that they are not planning more children , with Mrs Cameron revealing her doctor has told her : ' No way , Jose . ' She was pregnant throughout the 2010 campaign , and gave birth to their fourth child Florence in Cornwall after she arrived weeks early . Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron has ruled out having another baby , days after she and husband David cooed over seven - week - old Regan on a visit to Chorley , Lancashire . Baby talk has never been far from the couple 's mind as they have campaign across the country . Baby talk has never been far from the couple 's mind as they have campaigned across the country . On Friday Mr Cameron celebrated his emergence from the TV leaders ' debate unscathed with a visit to promote help for first time buyers . The couple cooed over seven - week - old Regan as they meet her parents , Robert Arron and Kelly Jeffers at a housing development in Chorley , Lancashire . Mr Cameron was heard quipping : ' Come on darling , maybe another one ? ' The Prime Minister , already a father of four , later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies . On a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday , Mrs Cameron , 43 , pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed , and said : ' I normally just drink this when I 'm pregnant ' Campaigning in Cornwall , Mr Cameron told House magazine : ' Definitely , we are not having another baby . ' Their fourth child Florence was born in the county in 2010 . David Cameron and his wife Samantha relax in Downing Street by watching Channel Four hit Gogglebox , the pair have admitted . The Prime Minister said the popular show was ' a very clever programme ' . But Samantha went further , reeling off her favourite characters filmed watching television . She said she ' loved ' Scarlett Moffat , the quick - witted northerner who become a cult figure over her sharp put downs caught on camera . Mrs Cameron said : ' I like the daughter in Newcastle . She 's so funny , I love her , she 's hilarious . I really think she 's great . The Siddiquis are good as well . ' After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said : ' Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody , but do n't worry , nothing is going to happen on that front . ' Then on a visit to a brewery in Cardiff yesterday , Mrs Cameron , 43 , pointed to a glass of Welsh Black stout she had been handed , and said : ' I normally just drink this when I 'm pregnant .

' Now they have moved to rule out categorically any idea that they might add to their brood . Campaigning in Cornwall , Mr Cameron told House magazine : ' Definitely , we are not having another baby . ' Mrs Cameron agreed : ' We are definitely not . ' She then added : ' The doctors have said ' no way , Jose ' . ' Mr Cameron chipped in : ' That 's another story , darling … But anyway . No , we are not having any more . The last one was born not ten miles from where we are now . ' Mrs Cameron gave birth to Florence in the middle of a family holiday to Cornwall in August 2010 . The Prime Minister drove with his wife to hospital for what they believed would be a routine check - up . But four hours later he was by her side when she gave birth by caesarean section to their 6 lb 1 oz ' unbelievably beautiful girl ' . It is believed Mr Cameron scrubbed up - wearing a gown and cap to reduce the chances of infection - for the delivery , which was three weeks early . The birth , at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro , came a year after the death of the Camerons ' six - year - old son Ivan , who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy .
